A player in zuluhotel can choose to specialize in various classes.  To
specialize in a class the player must invest a mininum number of skill
points in the class skills for that class.

Being part of a specialized class awards certain bonuses to the
player, these bonuses increase as the player reaches higher levels of
the class.

If a player chooses not to specialize in a class, or they train too
many skills that are not part of their class skills, they become a
"Power Player" who receives no class bonuses, but can train any skill
they wish to any level.

The available classes are:
-Bard
-Crafter
-Mage
-Ranger
-Theif
-Warrior
-Power Player *

(* power player isn't so much a class as it is a lack of being a
member of any other class)
